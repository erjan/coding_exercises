'''
Given an array points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane, return true if these points are a boomerang.

A boomerang is a set of three points that are all distinct and not in a straight line.

class Solution:
    def isBoomerang(self, points: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        (x0, y0), (x1, y1), (x2, y2) = points
        
        return (y2 - y1) * (x0 - x1) != (x2 - x1) * (y0 - y1)
