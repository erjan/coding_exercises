'''
You want to know how long a user visits your application. You decided to create bins of "[0-5>", "[5-10>", "[10-15>", and "15 minutes or more" and count the number of sessions on it.

Write an SQL query to report the (bin, total).

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.
'''

SELECT '[0-5>' AS 'bin', SUM(duration/60 < 5) AS 'total'
FROM Sessions
UNION
SELECT '[5-10>' AS 'bin', SUM(duration/60 >= 5 AND duration/60 < 10) AS 'total'
FROM Sessions
UNION
SELECT '[10-15>' AS 'bin', SUM(duration/60 >= 10 AND duration/60 < 15) AS 'total'
FROM Sessions
UNION
SELECT '15 or more' AS 'bin', SUM(duration/60 >= 15) AS 'total'
FROM Sessions
