Li Huaâ€™s job is to determine whether three line segments can form a 
right triangle
Assuming that the table line_segments saves all groups consisting of three 
line segments with lengths a, b, c, please help Li Hua write a SQL statement to determine whether each group of line segments can form a right triangle

when power(b,2) + power(c,2) = power(a,2) then 'Yes'
when power(a,2) + power(c,2) = power(b,2) then 'Yes'

else "No" end as right_triangle
