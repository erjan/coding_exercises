'''
Please write an SQL statement. For all courses of teacher Southern Emperor, query the course name (excluding Southern Emperor's course) that creation time is later than any course of Southern Emperor's from the courses table and the teachers table.

#my own solution


select c.name from courses c left join teachers t on t.id = c.teacher_id

where c.created_at > ANY(select x.created_at from courses x inner join teachers t2 on t2.id = x.teacher_id where t2.name  = 'Southern Emperor')
and 
c.name not in  (select c2.name from courses c2 left join teachers t on t.id = c2.teacher_id where t.name = 'Southern Emperor' )


---------------

cheating

select courses.name from courses
inner join teachers on teachers.id=courses.teacher_id
where created_at>'2020-4-22' and teacher_id != 4

----------------------------

SELECT name FROM courses
WHERE created_at > ANY(
	SELECT c.created_at FROM courses c,teachers t
	WHERE t.name = 'Southern Emperor' AND t.id = c.teacher_id
) AND teacher_id <> (
	SELECT id FROM teachers 
	WHERE name = 'Southern Emperor'
)


---------------
select name from courses where created_at >any (select courses.created_at from
courses where courses.teacher_id=(select id from teachers where name = "Southern Emperor")) and
teacher_id !=(select id from teachers where name = "Southern Emperor")


-----------------------
select name 
from courses
where created_at > any(
	select c.created_at 
	from teachers as t , courses as c  
	where t.name = 'Southern Emperor' and t.id = c.teacher_id
)
and teacher_id != (
	select id 
	from teachers
	where name = 'Southern Emperor'
)
