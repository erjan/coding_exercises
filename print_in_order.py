'''
Suppose we have a class:

public class Foo {
  public void first() { print("first"); }
  public void second() { print("second"); }
  public void third() { print("third"); }
}
The same instance of Foo will be passed to three different threads. Thread A will call first(), thread B will call second(), and thread C will call third(). Design a mechanism and modify the program to ensure that second() is executed after first(), and third() is executed after second().

class Foo:
    def __init__(self):
        self.locks = (Lock(),Lock())
        self.locks[0].acquire()
        self.locks[1].acquire()
        
    def first(self, printFirst):
        printFirst()
        self.locks[0].release()
        
    def second(self, printSecond):
        with self.locks[0]:
            printSecond()
            self.locks[1].release()
            
            
    def third(self, printThird):
