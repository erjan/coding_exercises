'''
Given a binary array nums, return the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array if you can flip at most one 0.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,0,1,1,0]
Output: 4
Explanation: Flip the first zero will get the maximum number of consecutive 1s. After flipping, the maximum number of consecutive 1s is 4.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,0,1,1,0,1]
Output: 4
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
nums[i] is either 0 or 1.
 

Follow up: What if the input numbers come in one by one as an infinite stream? In other words, you can't store all numbers coming from the stream as it's too large to hold in memory. Could you solve it efficiently?

                flipped = i # setting current zero's position as new flipped position

1: stringify list
2: split list by '0'
3: make a list that has length of consecutive 1.

Let's guess nums are [1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1]
Following above steps
[1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,1] -> "11111001101111" -> ["11111","","11","1111"] -> [5,0,2,4]

Last, use zip to get length sums of two adjecent of 1.

def findMaxConsecutiveOnes(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
    t = list(map(len, (''.join(map(str,nums))).split('0')))
    return max([a+b+1 for a,b in zip(t, t[1:])]) if len(t)>1 else len(nums)
----------------------------------------------------------

Algo
Define a slideing window from ii to i in which at most one 0 can exist.

Implementation

class Solution:
    def findMaxConsecutiveOnes(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        ans = cnt = ii = 0
        for i, x in enumerate(nums): 
            cnt += 1 - nums[i]
            while cnt > 1: 
                cnt -= 1 - nums[ii]
                ii += 1
            ans = max(ans, i - ii + 1)
        return ans 
Analysis
Time complexity O(N)
Space complexity O(1)

To answer the follow-up, we have to alter the algo as the sliding window approach needs to store the whole array. Here, we use two numbers prev and curr to store the lengths of the most revent two consecutive 1's (seperated by one 0).

class Solution:
    def findMaxConsecutiveOnes(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        ans = curr = 0
        prev = -1
        for x in nums: 
            if x == 0: prev, curr = curr, 0
            else: curr += 1
            ans = max(ans, prev + 1 + curr)
        return ans
