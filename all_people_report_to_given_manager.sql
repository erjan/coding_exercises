'''

Write an SQL query to find employee_id of all employees that directly or indirectly report their work to the head of the company.

The indirect relation between managers will not exceed three managers as the company is small.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 
 
 '''


SELECT e1.employee_id
FROM Employees e1,
     Employees e2,
     Employees e3
WHERE e1.manager_id = e2.employee_id
  AND e2.manager_id = e3.employee_id
  AND e3.manager_id = 1 
  AND e1.employee_id != 1
  
  
  -------------------------------
  
  WITH CTE AS (
    SELECT employee_id
    FROM Employees
    WHERE manager_id = 1 AND employee_id != 1
    UNION ALL
    SELECT e.employee_id
    FROM CTE c INNER JOIN Employees e ON c.employee_id = e.manager_id
)
SELECT employee_id
FROM CTE
ORDER BY employee_id
OPTION (MAXRECURSION 3);
