'''
You are playing a Flip Game with your friend.

You are given a string currentState that contains only '+' and '-'. You and your friend take turns to flip two consecutive "++" into "--". The game ends when a person can no longer make a move, and therefore the other person will be the winner.

Return true if the starting player can guarantee a win, and false otherwise.

 

Example 1:

Input: currentState = "++++"
Output: true
Explanation: The starting player can guarantee a win by flipping the middle "++" to become "+--+".
Example 2:

Input: currentState = "+"
Output: false
 

Constraints:

1 <= currentState.length <= 60
currentState[i] is either '+' or '-'.

  The problem is a Impartial game. In combinatorial game theory, the Spragueâ€“Grundy theorem states that every impartial game under the normal play convention is equivalent to a nim heap of a certain size. The size is called a nimber.

Nim is a mathematical game of strategy in which two players take turns removing objects from distinct heaps. On each turn, a player must remove at least one object, and may remove any number of objects provided they all come from the same heap.

For details about the theorem and nimber see @stellari's post or https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nimber.

The problem then become calculate the nimber of the given 'board' and return if it is equal to zero, for any non zero nimber, player 1 wins.

Since we will recursivly call the function nimber through out the test cases, we can use a static cache to do memoization in order to save time. If every nimber required is already known for string s then the time is just O(n) where n is the length of the string. Calculate nimber(n) from scratch is O(n^2).

import re
memo = [0, 0]

def nimber(self, n):
    size = len(self.memo)
    if n < size:
        return self.memo[n]
    if n > size:
        self.nimber(n - 1)
    ordinals = {self.memo[i] ^ self.memo[n - 2 - i] for i in xrange(n / 2)}
    ans = 0
    while ans in ordinals:
        ans += 1
    self.memo.append(ans)
    return ans

def canWin(self, s):
    ans = 0
    for n in map(len, re.split('-+', s)):
        ans ^= self.nimber(n)
    return ans != 0
