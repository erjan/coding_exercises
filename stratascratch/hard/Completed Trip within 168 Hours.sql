An event is logged in the events table with a timestamp each time a new rider attempts a signup (with an event name 'attempted_su') or successfully signs up (with an event name of 'su_success').


For each city and date, determine the percentage of signups in the first 7 days of 2022 that completed a trip within 168 hours of the signup date.
