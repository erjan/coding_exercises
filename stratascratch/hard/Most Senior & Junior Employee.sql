Write a query to find the number of days between the longest and least tenured employee still working for the company. Your output should include the number of employees with the longest-tenure, the number of employees with the least-tenure, and the number of days between both the longest-tenured and least-tenured hiring dates.


SELECT
  (SELECT count(id)
   FROM uber_employees
   WHERE hire_date = most_hire_date
   and termination_date IS NULL) AS shortest_tenured_count,

  (SELECT count(id)
   FROM uber_employees
   WHERE hire_date = least_hire_date
   and termination_date IS NULL) AS longest_tenured_count,

  (most_hire_date - least_hire_date) AS days_diff

FROM
  (SELECT max(hire_date) AS most_hire_date,
          min(hire_date) AS least_hire_date
   FROM uber_employees
   WHERE termination_date IS NULL ) tmp
