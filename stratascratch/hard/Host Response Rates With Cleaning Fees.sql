Find the average host response rate with a cleaning fee for each zipcode. Present the results as a percentage along with the zip code value.
Convert the column 'host_response_rate' from TEXT to NUMERIC using type casts and string processing (take missing values as NULL).
Order the result in ascending order based on the average host response rater after cleaning.

           END) :: NUMERIC AS clean_host_response_rate
