The CMO is interested in understanding how the sales of different product families are affected by promotional campaigns. To do so, for each product family, show the total number of units sold, as well as the percentage of units sold that had a valid promotion among total units sold. If there are NULLS in the result, replace them with zeroes. Promotion is valid if it's not empty and it's contained inside promotions table.
