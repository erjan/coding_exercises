Find the top 3 medal-winning teams by counting the total number of medals for each event in the Rio De Janeiro 2016 olympics. In case there is a tie, order the countries by name in ascending order. Output the event name along with the top 3 teams as the 'gold team', 'silver team', and 'bronze team', with the team name and the total medals under each column in format "{team} with {number of medals} medals". Replace NULLs with "No Team" string.
