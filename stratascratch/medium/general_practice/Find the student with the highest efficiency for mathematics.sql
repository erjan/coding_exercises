Find the student with the highest efficiency for mathematics?

The efficiency is defined as the score divided by hours studied.
Output the result along with the student id, hours studies and the obtained score for mathematics.
Sort the results based on the efficiency in the descending order.

student_id, hrs_studied,sat_math, sat_math/hrs_studied::float as effic,

order by effic desc )

select student_id, hrs_studied,sat_math, effic from h where rnk = 1
