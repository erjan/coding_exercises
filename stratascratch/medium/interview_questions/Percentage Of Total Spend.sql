Calculate the percentage of the total spend a customer spent on each order. Output the customerâ€™s first name, order details, and percentage of the order cost to their total spend across all orders.


Assume each customer has a unique first name (i.e., there is only 1 customer named Karen in the dataset) and that customers place at most only 1 order a day.


Percentages should be represented as decimals


select c.first_name,order_details,

total_order_cost/sum(total_order_cost)over(partition by c.first_name)::float

from orders o  inner join customers c on c.id = o.cust_id

--group by c.first_name, order_details,total_order_cost
