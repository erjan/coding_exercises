Meta/Facebook is developing a search algorithm that will allow users to search through their post history. You are assigned to evaluate the performance of this algorithm.


We have a table with the user's search term, search result positions, and whether or not the user clicked on the search result.


Write a query that assigns ratings to the searches in the following way:



If the search was not clicked for any term, assign the search with rating=1

If the search was clicked but the top position of clicked terms was outside the top 3 positions, give it a rating=2

If the search was clicked and the top position of a clicked term was in the top 3 positions, give it a rating=3


Output the search ID and it's rating.



with help as(
select 

search_id, 

case when clicked = 0 then 1 else 0 end as one,
case when clicked = 1 and search_results_position > 3 then 2 else 0 end as two,
case when clicked = 1 and search_results_position <= 3 then 3 else 0 end as three


from fb_search_events),

help2 as(
select
search_id,
unnest(array[one,two,three]) as rating
from help)

select search_id, max(rating) as max_rating from help2 group by 1
