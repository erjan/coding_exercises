After a new user creates an account and starts watching videos, the user ID, video ID, and date watched are captured in the database. Find the top 3 videos most users have watched as their first 3 videos. Output the video ID and the number of times it has been watched as the users' first 3 videos.


In the event of a tie, output all the videos in the top 3 that users watched as their first 3 videos.
