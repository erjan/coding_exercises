For each video, find how many unique users flagged it. A unique user can be identified using the combination of their first name and last name. Do not consider rows in which there is no flag ID.





select 

video_id, count(distinct concat(COALESCE(user_firstname, ''), coalesce(user_lastname, '')))
from user_flags
 
where flag_id is not null
group by video_id
