Write a query that returns the rate_type, loan_id and balance of each loan type, and a column that shows with what percentage the loan's balance contributes to the total balance among the loans of the same rate type.




select s1.loan_id, s1.rate_type , sum(s1.balance) as balance,
sum(s1.balance)::decimal/total_balance*100 as balance_share
from submissions s1 left join (select rate_type, sum(balance) as total_balance from submissions group by rate_type ) s2 on s1.rate_type = s2.rate_type

group by s1.loan_id, s1.rate_type , s2.total_balance
order by s1.rate_type,s1.loan_id
