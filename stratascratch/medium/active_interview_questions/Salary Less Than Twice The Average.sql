select 

m1.manager_empl_id,
d1.salary as manager_salary,
avg(d2.salary) as avg_employeesalary

from map_employee_hierarchy 
m1  join dim_employee d1
on d1.empl_id = m1.manager_empl_id
join dim_employee d2 on d2.empl_id = m1.empl_id

group by d1.salary, m1.manager_empl_id
having d1.salary < 2*avg(d2.salary)
