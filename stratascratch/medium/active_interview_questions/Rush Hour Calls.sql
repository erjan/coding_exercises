Redfin helps clients to find agents. Each client will have a unique request_id and each request_id has several calls. For each request_id, the first call is an “initial call” and all the following calls are “update calls”.  How many customers have called 3 or more times between 3 PM and 6 PM (initial and update calls combined)?



SELECT 
COUNT(DISTINCT request_id) 
FROM redfin_call_tracking 
WHERE extract(hour from created_on) BETWEEN 15 AND 18
GROUP BY request_id HAVING COUNT(*) >= 3
