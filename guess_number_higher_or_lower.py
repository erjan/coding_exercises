'''
We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.

You call a pre-defined API int guess(int num), which returns three possible results:

-1: Your guess is higher than the number I picked (i.e. num > pick).
1: Your guess is lower than the number I picked (i.e. num < pick).
0: your guess is equal to the number I picked (i.e. num == pick).
Return the number that I picked.

# The guess API is already defined for you.
# @param num, your guess
# @return -1 if num is higher than the picked number
#          1 if num is lower than the picked number
#          otherwise return 0
# def guess(num: int) -> int:

class Solution:
    def guessNumber(self, n: int) -> int:
        
        low = 1
        high = n+1
                
        num = high
        
        while low <= high:

            mid = low + (high - low)//2
            pick = guess(mid)
            if pick == 0:
                return mid

            elif pick == 1:
                low = mid + 1

            else:
                high = mid - 1
