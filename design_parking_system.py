'''
Design a parking system for a parking lot. The parking lot has three kinds of parking 
spaces: big, medium, and small, with a fixed number of slots for each size.

Implement the ParkingSystem class:

ParkingSystem(int big, int medium, int small) Initializes object of the ParkingSystem class. The number of 
slots for each parking space are given as part of the constructor.
bool addCar(int carType) Checks whether there is a parking space of carType for the car that wants to get 
into the parking lot. carType can be of three kinds: big, medium, or small, which 
are represented by 1, 2, and 3 respectively. A car can only park in a parking space of 
its carType. If there is no space available, return false, else park the car in that size space and return true.

class ParkingSystem:

    def __init__(self, big: int, medium: int, small: int):
        self.slot = list([big, medium, small])
        
        

    def addCar(self, carType: int) -> bool:
        s = self.slot
        
            
        if s[carType-1] > 0:
            s[carType-1] -=1
            return True
                
        return False
            
        


# Your ParkingSystem object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = ParkingSystem(big, medium, small)
# param_1 = obj.addCar(carType)
