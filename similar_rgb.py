'''
The red-green-blue color "#AABBCC" can be written as "#ABC" in shorthand.

For example, "#15c" is shorthand for the color "#1155cc".
The similarity between the two colors "#ABCDEF" and "#UVWXYZ" is -(AB - UV)2 - (CD - WX)2 - (EF - YZ)2.

Given a string color that follows the format "#ABCDEF", return a string represents the color that is most similar to the given color and has a shorthand (i.e., it can be represented as some "#XYZ").

Any answer which has the same highest similarity as the best answer will be accepted.
