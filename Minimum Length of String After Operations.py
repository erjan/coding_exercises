'''
You are given a string s.

You can perform the following process on s any number of times:

Choose an index i in the string such that there is at least one character to the left of index i that is equal to s[i], and at least one character to the right that is also equal to s[i].
Delete the closest character to the left of index i that is equal to s[i].
Delete the closest character to the right of index i that is equal to s[i].
Return the minimum length of the final string s that you can achieve.

class Solution:
    def minimumLength(self, s: str) -> int:
        # Step 1: Count the frequency of each character in the string
        char_frequency_map = Counter(s)

        # Step 2: Calculate the number of characters to delete
        delete_count = 0
        for frequency in char_frequency_map.values():
            if frequency % 2 == 1:
                # If frequency is odd, delete all except one
                delete_count += frequency - 1
            else:
                # If frequency is even, delete all except two
                delete_count += frequency - 2

        # Step 3: Return the minimum length after deletions
        return len(s) - delete_count
